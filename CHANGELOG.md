# 1.0.0
Initial release of the kr_builder package, which provides the following widgets:

* KrFutureBuilder: a replacement for FutureBuilder that adds support for loading, error, and empty states, and can display a shimmer effect during loading.
* ShimmerBloc: a widget that displays a shimmer effect on a card-like container.

This release includes the following features:

* Support for loading, error, and empty states in KrFutureBuilder.
* Support for shimmer effect in KrFutureBuilder and ShimmerBloc.
* Basic example to showcase KrFutureBuilder and ShimmerBloc usage.

We hope this package will be helpful for developers who want to simplify the implementation of asynchronous operations in their apps.
